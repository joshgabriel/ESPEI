This directory contains input files to ESPEI to reproduce the results of the paper "Uncertainty propagation of unary components for the Bayesian inference of n-nary phase diagrams: Example of Cuâ€“Mg" by Joshua J. Gabriel, Noah H. Paulson accepted in Calphad 2024

1. Cu-Mg_genCM.tdb is a template TDB for the propagation analysis of copper and magnesium unary parameters on the Cu-Mg phase diagram. 

2. Cu-Mg_phases.json , espei-in.yaml , run_mcmc_template.py are input files for ESPEI. 

3. pduq_plot.py, plot_pd_*.py plot the phase diagram from ESPEI outputs.
